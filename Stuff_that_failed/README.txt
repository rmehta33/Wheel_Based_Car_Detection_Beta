Project 3 and 4 are C++ based methods which try to use Open Vision to accomplish the project. Needless to say they failed.

EDTest - Edge Detection program written in C++. Would have replaced the point based difference method.

HandGuestureRecognition - Tried to alter this to find wheels instead. Did not work as it used hand color to indentify guestures.

Other methods were attempted but eventually got replaced with other trials.
